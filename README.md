# ethermint-gatewayï¼š

## Abstract
ethermint-gateway is the gateway service of ethermint blockchain. Its purpose is to better help ordinary programmers 
who do not understand the blockchain to complete the on-chain operation through etherming-gateway.

## Project launch:

ethermint-gateway completes compilation or runtime with go build/run. The default service listening address is 127.0.0.1:8000. To change the value, run the -addr command. 
go run ethermint-gateway -addr 127.0.0.1:8080 


## configuration file:
We put the ethermint-gateway configuration file in config.yaml


## API:
